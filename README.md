# MLBB-Data-exploration

Summary and Findings of the MLBB Dataset Project
This project analyzed data from the MLBB (Mobile Legends: Bang Bang) dataset using SQL to uncover insights about heroes, their roles, abilities, and performance metrics. The analysis addressed ten targeted questions, each focusing on a specific aspect of hero attributes, performance, and characteristics. Below is a summary of the findings for each question:

1 Top 5 Heroes with the Highest Physical Damage
2. Mage Heroes Released After 2020-01-01
3.Top 10 Heroes by Win Rate
4.Average Mana Regeneration for Each Primary Role
5.Heroes with Both Primary and Secondary Roles (Sorted by Release Date)
6.Heroes with Above-Average Physical Defense
7.Heroes with the Highest Movement Speed in Each Lane
8.Heroes with a Win-Loss Difference Over 100 in Esports
9.Lane with the Most Heroes
10.Heroes Starting with 'A' and Movement Speed Below 250

Key Findings:
1.The analysis provides actionable insights for optimizing hero selection based on damage output, win rate, or defensive capabilities.
2.Recent additions to specific roles, such as Mages, can guide players looking for fresh and updated heroes.
3.Identifying high-mobility heroes and those with exceptional win records can significantly enhance lane performance and team strategy.
4.Understanding hero distribution across lanes and roles offers a better grasp of game balance and strategic deployment.

Conclusion:
This project demonstrates how SQL can be effectively used to extract meaningful insights from gaming datasets. The findings can be leveraged by players and analysts to refine strategies, understand hero dynamics, and optimize gameplay performance.
